# My-First-Software-Development-Repository---Wk2
This software repository contains my first software for the module Software Development. It stores all of the related files including a README file which contains information about the software I have written.

I have fundamental knowledge of software development with Python. I can write simple programmes, for example to perform calculations, as well as use packages such as pandas.
I am learning about software versioning, as this is important for keeping a record of work and fixing errors.
